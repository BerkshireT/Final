<blockquote>
We provide a brief summary of Factor&mdash;a stack-based
and concatenative, object-oriented programming language. Factor 
(<a href="http://www.factorcode.org">www.factorcode.org</a>)
is a uniquely blended concatenative programming language 
that combines the core concepts of object-oriented programming 
(e.g., classes, polymorphism) with the flexibility and power 
of the functional programming paradigm. Factor programs are 
written using chains of higher-order functions that manipulate
data on a data stack. Programs are developed using
the interactive development environment called the Factor 
Listener. Code written by the user is immediately compiled by 
Factor's optimizing compiler and stored within the currently 
operating image of the language mixing the ease of
experimentation of interpreted languages with the performance 
of a compiled one. With all of these features in place and rich 
libraries of useful functions Factor presents itself as an 
emerging language worthy of wider consideration.
